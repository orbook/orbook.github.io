# About this book

This Open Research Book is based on 15 scripts written at Oxford
Brookes University.  The original author was Joseph Corneli.
Editorial oversight was provided by Robyn Curtis.  Eric White and
David Bullock provided further input on the contents.  In line with
our agreements as participants in the UK Reproducibility Network’s
Open Research Programme, the videos and scripts have been released
under a permissive open licence (CC By SA).

A public-facing website based on the scripts has been published at
[https://orbook.github.io](https://orbook.github.io).  The site is
created from Markdown [sources](https://github.com/orbook/orbook.github.io/tree/sources)
using the static site generator [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/).

Given the existence of resources such as:
- the [Open Science Training Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book) (2018),
- the [Guide for Reproducible Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/reproducible-research) (2019-ongoing),
- the [GO-GN Open Research Handbook](https://go-gn.net/gogn_outputs/open-research-handbook/) (2023),
- and the PathOS [Open Science Impact Indicator Handbook](https://handbook.pathos-project.eu/) (2024),
(among others) it’s worth asking why would put in the effort to create a new
book on open research.

The answer has to do with the comprehensive and thoroughgoing effort
to embed open research in institutional practice and culture that the
6-year UKRN [Open Research
Programme](https://www.ukrn.org/open-research-programme/) represents.
Over the course of the ORP, we expect to develop over 180 trainers via
a national-level train-the-trainer programme, who will go on to train
over 2700 people in UK research institutions.  The [Training
Schema](https://www.ukrn.org/training-schema/) that we’re following
covers a wide range of topics, several of which are simply not covered
in the other resources mentioned above.  We also need to develop a
resource in which open research topics are covered in a practical and
well-integrated way, suited to our working context.

Starting from approximately 60 pages of material in the original
scripts, members of the UKRN
[https://www.ukrn.org/ukrn-community-of-practice/](Training Community
of Practice) have been invited to contribute to the further evolution
of this material.  The editorial workflow will develop across Google
Docs (by invitation), Github, and in Hypothesis comments on the
published pages.  The hope is that the contents will grow to around
250 pages.
